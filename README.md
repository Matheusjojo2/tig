- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on helping [Miguel](https://github.com/migueldeicaza) implement his vision of world-domination through console GUIs by shepherding [Terminal.Gui, aka gui.cs](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs). 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to lead an OSS project I didn't start.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Terminal.Gui, aka gui.cs](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs) and [winprint](https://github.com/tig/winprint).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have no idea what I'm doing.
